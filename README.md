## Rules
### Setup
#### Board Sizes
##### Small
The minimal 7 by 14 grid is meant for quick gameplay on the go, mostly on small sheets on paper.
It is not recommended for normal gameplay as the limited board quickly results in most usable space getting filled up.
##### Medium
A 14 by 28 grid with 2 by 2 bases or a 15 by 30 grid with 3 by 3 bases is optimal for normal gameplay.
The board is large enough to allow for complexity and large-scale strategy in deciding how to expand masses and build bridges.
Moreover, the board is small enough to prevent one from spending hours on a single game.
##### Large
The 21 by 42 grid with a 3 by 3 base is the gold standard in official Conquid gameplay.
It offers greater opportunity for complexity and large-scale strategy.
Be warned, games on this large of a scale are time consuming and best done over long breaks.
#### Bases
##### Base Locations
Each player base should be centered vertically along the middle row of the board.
Also, each base should be as close to the left and right walls as possible,
but leave enough space between each base and the wall to allow vanquish.
So far, this space is 4 cells.
